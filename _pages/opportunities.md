### Are we recruiting?

We are no longer recruiting PhD students, or undergrads. We might be looking for 1-2 Masters students in Fall; see below.

<!-- Yes, we are actively recruiting PhD students in this 🍁 Fall!
<!-- Please keep an eye out for the [announcement of admissions for the PhD Program](https://www.cs.usc.edu/ph-d-application-information/). -->
<!-- Please see below to figure out if [your research interests align with ours](/publications/), and apply to the [USC PhD Admissions](https://www.cs.usc.edu/ph-d-application-information/) by ⚡ [Dec 15th, 2023](https://days.to/until/15-december) and select [Swabha](https://www.cs.usc.edu/directory/faculty/profile/?lname=Swayamdipta&fname=Swabha) as a potential advisor. USC has waived GRE scores for graduate admissions and offers [fee waivers](https://gradadm.usc.edu/lightboxes/us-students-fee-waivers/) to select applicants. -->
<!-- ### Should you send Swabha an email? -->

Due to the high volume of email, there is very <span class="emphasized">little chance Swabha will be responsive to your email, sorry!</span> See special cases below.
&nbsp;

#### PhD Applicants

We recruit PhDs only through the formal PhD application at USC. We will announce open slots, if any, only in late Fall 2024. There is very little chance Swabha will respond to any email about PhD recruitment, sorry!

<!-- We carefully consider every single PhD application we receive. -->
<!-- However, if you do email Swabha, drop in a few lines about your past research, and why you're interested in working with the DILL Lab. -->
<!-- Swabha will definitely read your email if and when she sees your application. 👀 -->
